Infrasctructure level security requires https, firewalls etc
Application level security


Application level security - Tokens are consent bw client and secured services
JWT token consists of 3 parts
1. HEADER - Essential token information like the key algorithm used for signing
2. PAYLOAD - JSON that contains generic token info, like when the was created and some info about the user
3. SIGNATURE (using some secret key) - Hash of payload, used to ensure the data wasn't tampered with
 
Creating User Steps
1. Use cloud service API like aws cognito to create user pools, principals, password reset etc.
2. Use cloud user service SDK in login end point to login user
3. If user logged in successfully then generate and return token

Adding token steps
1. Create service to generate token to access secured services. This service will authenticate user first using username/password combination before reutrning token. If not using the web client use POST method to login endpoint to avoid sending username password on the wire
2. Add user claims to token 
3. On secured services we need to make sure than valid token is required before granting access to user, this can be done using same key we used to sign the original token and then getting the user principals, toke expiry to check if user is granted the permissions to access the resources.
4. Pass the token from client to service as Bearer token on each request (Authorization: Bearer generated_token)
